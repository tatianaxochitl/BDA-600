        <h1>ARIMA Model</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>A</strong>uto <strong>R</strong>egressive
          <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>M</strong>oving <strong>A</strong>verage, also known as
          <strong>ARIMA</strong> is a model primarily used for time series forecasting. The model focuses
          on Autocorrelations in the data, which is the degree of similarity
          between a time series and a lagged version of itself over succesive time intervals.



        </p>
        <h2>Three Variables to Account for:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>P</strong> = The periods of lag used. For example, P = 5 would use five previous periods of the time series
          in the Auto Regressive portion of the model.
        <br>
        <br>
          Note: A purely Auto Regressive model will look more like a linear regression.
        <br>
        <br>
          <strong>D</strong> = The number of differencing transformations used to make the 
          tim series stationary.
        <br>
        <br>
          Note: When it comes to predictive modeling of time series data, Stationarity is the idea that the 
          mean and the variance are constant over time. This makes for easier prediction. The process of "differencing" starts by taking the difference of the 
          current and previous time periods. If the resulting values do not center around a constant mean or variance, then
          differencing is continued using the previous period and the first difference.
        <br>
        <br>
          <strong>Q</strong> = The lag of error component where the component is a part of the time series not
          explained by trend or seasonality.
        <br>
